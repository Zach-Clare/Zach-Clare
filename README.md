Hey! 👽 

I'm Zach and I make all kinds of software! I specialise in Web Development (HTML+CSS, JS, PHP) but I have experience with a bunch of different technologies (Python, C++, C#).

If you're here to look at some of my web projects, you can take a look at the following:
- (Authwave for Python)[https://github.com/Authwave/python-client] is a Python port of Authwave's cryptographically secure user authentication system.
- A (JavaScript Image Cropper)[https://github.com/Zach-Clare/js-image-cropper] to help streaming user image uploads. Works effortlessly with touch devices, too.
- (RoseMask)[https://github.com/Zach-Clare/rosemask] is a Chrome extension that helps those with reading difficulties on the web.
- A work-in-progress (Musical Archive)[https://musicalarchive.helixsoftware.uk] site based on Craft CMS. (Here's the Repo)[https://github.com/Zach-Clare/musicalarchive].
- And a work-in-progress (Art Site)[https://github.com/Zach-Clare/evejansenart] for the extremely talented (Eve Jansen)[https://www.instagram.com/evejansenart/].
