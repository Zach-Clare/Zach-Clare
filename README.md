Hey! 🌱

I'm Zach and I make all kinds of software! Once upon a time, I specialised in Web Development (HTML+CSS, JS, PHP) but I now work with such a variety of different technologies that it's difficult to specify my most common platforms (including Python, C++, C#, IDL, bash, etc.). I'm currently working For University College London on the data processing pipeline for the [SMILE space mission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMILE_(spacecraft)) - a joint mission by the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) and the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/) due to launch in ~~December 2025~~ Summer 2026. This includes a [3D renderer from scratch in C++](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/birp_cpp), as well as a multi-stage machine learning process (which is in very active development).

If you're here to look at some of my web projects, you can take a look at the following:
- [Authwave for Python](https://github.com/Authwave/python-client) is a Python port of Authwave's cryptographically secure user authentication system.
- A [JavaScript Image Cropper](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/js-image-cropper) to allow site users to edit their own image uploads on HTML forms. Works effortlessly with touch devices, too.
- [RoseMask](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/rosemask) is a Chrome extension that helps those with reading difficulties on the web. ~~[You can try it out here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rosemask/kijieflhjgpcjmnnoiiaimiffoaignjh)~~ I'm currently having some Google Developer problems. Sorry about that.
- A work-in-progress Musical Archive site based on Craft CMS. [Here's the Repo](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/musicalarchive).
- And a work-in-progress Art Gallery Site for the extremely talented [Eve Jansen](https://www.instagram.com/evejansenart/). And again, [here's the repo](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/evejansenart).

If you're looking for something more unique, these might be more to your taste:
- A [3D renderer from scratch in C++](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/birp_cpp) for use in a data processing pipeline for ESA and CAS's SMILE space mission.
- [EarthTones](https://github.com/eliot-chill/earthtones) is a complete system for wildfire management using a fleet of Arduinos. The Arduino code and the Web code are located on different branches in this repository. You can browse them by using the small dropdown on the top left of the project page.
- A [Python-based Modular Synthesiser](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/uol_final_year) based on O. Belanger's [Pyo DSP Module](https://github.com/belangeo/pyo). This project can be difficult to get working yourself, so I've made it easy to [see a demonstration](https://youtu.be/T2GpbmC3jq8) and to [read the academic paper](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/uol_final_year/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf). (Note that in the paper, I have used my birth name - Thomas. It is me, I promise. 🙌)
