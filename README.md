Hey! 👽 

I'm Zach and I make all kinds of software! I specialise in Web Development (HTML+CSS, JS, PHP) but I have experience with a bunch of different technologies (Python, C++, C#).

If you're here to look at some of my web projects, you can take a look at the following:
- [Authwave for Python](https://github.com/Authwave/python-client) is a Python port of Authwave's cryptographically secure user authentication system.
- A [JavaScript Image Cropper](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/js-image-cropper) to help streaming user image uploads. Works effortlessly with touch devices, too.
- [RoseMask](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/rosemask) is a Chrome extension that helps those with reading difficulties on the web. [You can try it out here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rosemask/kijieflhjgpcjmnnoiiaimiffoaignjh).
- A work-in-progress [Musical Archive](https://musicalarchive.helixsoftware.uk) site based on Craft CMS. [Here's the Repo](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/musicalarchive).
- And a work-in-progress [Art Site](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/evejansenart) for the extremely talented [Eve Jansen](https://www.instagram.com/evejansenart/).

If you're looking for something more unique, these might be more your taste:
- [EarthTones](https://github.com/eliot-chill/earthtones) is a complete system for wildfire management using a fleet of Arduinos. The Arduino code and the Web code are located on different branches in this repository. You can browse them by using the small dropdown on the top left of the project page.
- A [Python-based Modular Synthesiser](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/uol_final_year) based on O. Belanger's [Pyo DSP Module](https://github.com/belangeo/pyo). This project can be finnicky to get working yourself, so I've made it easy to [see a domenstration](https://youtu.be/T2GpbmC3jq8) and to [read the academic paper](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/uol_final_year/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf). (Note that in the paper, I have used my birth name - Thomas. It is me, I promise. 🙌)
