Hey! 🌱

I'm Zach and I make all kinds of software! I specialise in Web Development (HTML+CSS, JS, PHP) but I have experience with an _array_ of different technologies (Python, C++, C#, IDL). I'm currently working For University College London on a spacecraft image simulator for the SMILE space mission - a joint mission by the [European Space Agency](https://www.esa.int/) and the [Chinese Academy of Sciences](https://english.cas.cn/) due to launch in March 2025. Unfortunately, that code isn't public, but I have a few repositories you can take a look at, if that's what you're here for.

If you're here to look at some of my web projects, you can take a look at the following:
- [Authwave for Python](https://github.com/Authwave/python-client) is a Python port of Authwave's cryptographically secure user authentication system.
- A [JavaScript Image Cropper](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/js-image-cropper) to allow site users to edit their own image uploads on HTML forms. Works effortlessly with touch devices, too.
- [RoseMask](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/rosemask) is a Chrome extension that helps those with reading difficulties on the web. [You can try it out here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rosemask/kijieflhjgpcjmnnoiiaimiffoaignjh).
- A work-in-progress [Musical Archive](https://musicalarchive.helixsoftware.uk) site based on Craft CMS. [Here's the Repo](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/musicalarchive).
- And a work-in-progress [Art Gallery Site](https://evejansenart-com.stackstaging.com/) for the extremely talented [Eve Jansen](https://www.instagram.com/evejansenart/). And again, [here's the repo](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/evejansenart). The site link is currently hosted on a development server, meaning that the information about each piece is placeholder, and almost definately isn't accurate to the pieces displayed. If you're on Google Chrome, it may try to direct you to Eve's current website made with Wix. To see the site I have created, click "Ignore".

If you're looking for something more unique, these might be more to your taste:
- [EarthTones](https://github.com/eliot-chill/earthtones) is a complete system for wildfire management using a fleet of Arduinos. The Arduino code and the Web code are located on different branches in this repository. You can browse them by using the small dropdown on the top left of the project page.
- A [Python-based Modular Synthesiser](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/uol_final_year) based on O. Belanger's [Pyo DSP Module](https://github.com/belangeo/pyo). This project can be finnicky to get working yourself, so I've made it easy to [see a demonstration](https://youtu.be/T2GpbmC3jq8) and to [read the academic paper](https://github.com/Zach-Clare/uol_final_year/blob/main/Project%20Report.pdf). (Note that in the paper, I have used my birth name - Thomas. It is me, I promise. 🙌)
